Play Koi-Koi with multiple people!

It actually works!

## Running the program

This code is only for the client side stuff.

### The Client

You will need LOVE installed to run the client.
When you are in the client directory, type into the command line: love . and it should all magically work. In particular, you should get a window appear and ask you for your username.

Alternatively, you can drag the folder containing all the code on to the LOVE icon and it should all work.
